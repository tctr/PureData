#X text 36 200 When specifying relative paths \, you can use the prefix
"./" that specifies "this folder" \, which is not needed as it is implicitly
defined when we don't use it. The “../” prefix \, on the other
hand \, refers to the parent directory \, and “../../” is the parent’s
parent directory and so on…, f 60;
#X text 36 280 These can be expanded to subfolders. If you have a prefix
like “files/” (or “./files”) \, Pd searches inside a subfolder
named “files” in A) \, B) and C). Conversely \, something like
“../files” will look in a subfolder named “files” in the parent
patch as relative to A) \, B) and C).;

#X text 36 32 Pd can load files and externals in a patch. You can specify
an absolute directory for that (which is a complete path \, from root
\, and not very convenient)., f 60;
#X text 36 85 But Pd also automatically searches for these in specific
folders. Hence \, we can use them or use folders relative to them instead.
In order of priority \, such folders are \; - A) The folder where the
patch is saved \; - B) User Added Paths (set in Pd => Preferences =>
Path) \; - C) Pd’s Standard Path (a.k.a. the “extra” folder inside
Pd’s Application).;
#X text 488 19 As an example we send the "read" message to an array
\, where Pd looks for a "table.txt" file inside a subfolder named "txt".
Since the file is included in a folder in case "A)" \, this task is
performed successfully. The write message works in the same way., f
