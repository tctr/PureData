#X text 30 31 We studied how the most classic waveforms can be obtained
with a sum of harmonic partials \, namely: Sawtooh \, Triangle \, Square
and Impulse. Nonetheless \, they need an infinite sum of partials and
we have aliasing for frequencies over the Nyquist \, which sounds bad!
A Band Limited oscillator has only frequency components up to the nyquist
\, which means that its frequency band is limited to the range from
0 to the Nyquist frequency. Therefore it avoids aliasing!;
#X text 30 154 We can design an oscillator with a limited number of
partials via additive synthesis \, but having too many oscillators
is unnecessarily computationally expensive. Instead \, we can have
wavetables created with a limited number of partials as shown in previous
examples here on this tutorial. One caveat is that one should probably
have more than one wavetable for each waveform. Since aliasing only
occurs at high frequencies \, you can have a waveform with more partials
for lower frequencies and less partials for higher frequencies., f

#X text 30 304 You can still generate aliasing if you have too many
partials and a high enough fundamental. At 44.1khz \, Your partial
limit is 10 For a fundamental of 2 Khz \, but for 200 hz it goes up
to 100!;

#X text 30 425 It generates tables internally for each waveform and
you can set and change them \, which happens without crossfading. You
can also set and change the number of partials \, which rewrites all
internal tables (whatch for clicks)., f 59;
#X text 30 373 The [bl.osc~] object from ELSE is a band-limited impulse
oscillator based on the [wavetable~] object and it includes bandlimited
wavetables for these classic waveforms.;
#X text 30 490 Morover \, the first argument sets the waveform \, the
second sets the number of partials and the third sets the initial frequency
(a 4th argument also sets initial phase). This object also has inlets
for hard sync and phase modulation. Check its help file for more details.
, f 59;
#X text 30 570 Note \, however \, that hard sync also generates aliasing
because it alters the waveform and generatres immediate jumps (discontinuitities).
We'll see other options for hard syncing without aliasig.;
