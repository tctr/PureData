#X text 40 49 The [gray~] object from ELSE uses "gray code" to change
bits randomly. A "gray code" is a list of numbers where you change
one bit at a time. They're useful for many sorts of things and was
not really intended to generate audible audio \, but hey \, why not?

#X text 40 112 This object was inspired by a SuperCollider class and
it is based on it. Since it is not a standard noise source for audio
applications \, there is no principle for its spectral quality \, unlike
[white~] \, [pink~] and [brown~]. It does favor frequency content in
the lower range and sits somewhere in between [brown~] and [pink~]
\, but the sound quality is quite "harsh" and "glitchy" \, whatever
that means \, but you can see how the waveform has a tendency for harsh
discontinuities., f 88;
