#X text 36 55 By converting an analog signal into a digital one \,
we need to approximate the values to the possible ones according to
the bit depth. This process is called "Quantization" and generates
a floor noise. The bigger the bit depth \, the lower the noise floor
- this is the most important factor of the bit depth!, f 76;
#X text 36 203 Each bit provides a dynamic range of 6.0206 dB \, which
is the same proportion of twice as much. Hence \, 16 bits gives us
a dynamic range of about 96.33 dB. This means that the noise floor
is about 96dB below an amplitude of "1". The range of 24 bits would
be 144.5 dB \, which would be crazy and \, as discussed \, not actually
possible even in sound cards that say they operate with 24 bits resolution.
Considering a more plausible maximum of 20/21 bits \, we have about
120 dB and a bit over., f 76;
#X text 36 133 The noise floor is what defines the dynamic range \,
expressed as the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR). This is the ratio between
the maximum possible amplitude and the noise floor generated by the
quantization error. This ratio is given in dB (decibels). More about
how dB works soon., f 76;
