#X text 24 16 The [white~] object from ELSE is a white noise generator
that has more flexibility \, like having a "clip" mode (whose output
is either -1 or 1) and an internal seed that is based on the current
time \, so every time you first create the object you get a different
seed. Each copy of [white~] gets its own seed as well and besides setting
a given seed you can also set it to a new seed based on the current
system time at any point.;

#X text 508 65 The example below has the '-clip' flag set (so the output
is either -1 or 1). Check that this doesn't affect the sound quality
of the white noise \, it only reflects on a higher RMS of 0 dBFS!,

#X text 25 140 The quality of the pseudo random number generator is
also supposed to be better than vanilla's [noise~] \, but this has
no real perceptual effect. Vanilla uses a "Linear Congruential Generator"
technique for generating random numbers \, but not any standard/tested
algorithm \, while [white~] uses a Tausworthe generator that is also
used in SuperCollider. All pseudo random number generator objects in
ELSE use this algorithm instead., f 63;
