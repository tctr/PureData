#X text 29 17 The [brown~] object is a brown noise generator that has
a decay of 6 dB per octave by default \, so it sounds less hissy than
white noise. The name is not from a color analogy \, instead it refers
to "brownian noise" \, which is produced by brownian motion (the random
motion of particles suspended in a medium like a liquid or a gas).
It is named after Robert Brown \, who documented the erratic motion
for multiple types of inanimate particles in water. Brown noise is
also known as "red noise" \, which is in fact a color analogy because
red light has longer wavelengths (hence \, it's lower in the spectrum).

#X text 29 278 You can use [noise~] to create brown noise since its
output are random values that can be used as random steps. White noise
output is from -1 to 1 so you have to multiply it by 0.125 to get random
steps up or down (whose maximum amplitude is 0.125)., f 64;
#X text 29 345 We then need to sum this maximum step value to the last
output and perform bound checks. We do this with the [fexpr~] object
and the way this object works only becomes clear later in this tutorial
when we study advanced filters., f 64;

#X text 29 168 Brownian motion is a type of random walk. We'll see
more about random walk later when studying chaotic and stochastic random
control \, but the way it works is simple. From a starting value point
\, you have a random step up or down whose maximum value is 0.125 \,
then when you reach that step you have another random move up or down.
If you cross the -1 or 1 bounds \, the value is folded back (1.02 becomes
0.98 \, for instance)., f 64;
#X text 30 413 You can change the maximum step but that alters the
spectral quality \, where higher steps sound more like white noise
and smaller values sound less bright (or more "red")., f 64;
